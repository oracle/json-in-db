# json-in-db

This repository contains downloadable and installable demonstrations for the JSON capabilities of Oracle Database 12.1.0.2.0 and later. Each demonstration can be installed independantly of any of the other demonstrations. Each demonstration has it's own folder within the json-in-db repository. In order to install and run all of the demonstrations, except for the Python-Demo-App, the XFILES application must be installed first. The XFILES application can be found in the oracle/xml-sample-demo-master/s repository. 

The INTRODUCTION example provides a simple introduction to storing, indexing and querying JSON documents with Oracle Database 12c. More information on how to download, install and run the INTRODUCTION example can be found in the installation.md file located in the INTRODUCTION folder.

The Python-Demo-App example is a simple python web application that showcases how Oracle Database 12c can be used as a JSON document store. The app is a basic social directory template. More information on how to download, install and run the Python-Demo-App can be found in the README.markdown file located in the Python-Demo-App folder.

The RESTDEMO example provides a simple introduction to using a REST API to manipulate JSON Documents stored in Oracle Database 12c. The REST API provides a Rest Interface to document collections managed by an Oracle Database. The API is delivered as part of Oracle Rest Data Services (ORDS) 3.0. This means that you must have installed ORDS 3.0 in order to use this example. More information on how to download, install and run the SCHEMALESS example can be found in the installation.md file located in the SCHEMALESS folder.

The SCHEMALESS example show how Oracle Database 12c provides full support for schema-less application development. It consists of a very simple application that allows the end user to define a data model and then store and retrieve documents based on that data model. The application allows the user to add and remove fields at will from each record. The documents are stored in the Oracle Database using JSON. More information on how to download, install and run the SCHEMALESS example can be found in the installation.md file located in the SCHEMALESS  folder.
